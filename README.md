# Deltatre Utils

This is a general purpose library of helpers useful for C# .NET projects.
The main tools you can find here are:
 - extension methods for .NET BCL types
 - data transfer objects useful for common programming tasks
 - custom types implementing auto safe logics (non empty string and non empty sequence for instance)
 - a simple timer class useful to execute an asynchronous task periodically
